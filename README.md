# BTS Document Automation


The purpose of this script is to automate changes necessary for Buffer Testing Solution Reworks used in manufacturing. 

Within the manufacturing environment, documentation is used to ensure the quality of products for consumers, regulatory authorities, and our own quality values. 
Ensuring that these documents contain the correct information despite the demands to produce many of them in the context of manufacturing pressures is a difficult balancing act.
Therefore, the goal of this script is to automate these documents to ensure high quality and consumer confidence in the products and in the quality process. 


This script will use a word document, which uses the Merge Field formatting to declare variables that the user will input the values of. This document will then be saved
to a local path of the user's choice, and the Microsoft Word Application will be launched to ensure a final quality review of the documentation. 

After the implementation of this script, the documentation creation time fell by 96%. Generally for a single document it will take 6 minutes, using this script will
only takes 12 seconds. In the manufacturing environment, it may be necessary to create as many as 15 of these documents, using the previous rate with this script, it 
will take a cummalative 3 minutes. Using the manual system would take 90 minutes.
